# Pulmonem

## Project Description
The project Pulmonem is a speculative web project created for the project Studio class CART 411 at Concordia University. The project is composed of a 3D rendered video, a 3D generated Model, a snapchat filter and a final Website presenting all those works. The project's narrative is based on a dystopian future where human are unable to breath earth's air and have to inject themselves with DNA altering substances to create additional, pulmonary organs. 

## Technical Background
The website was created using an online template for full page scrolling and a to create the animated background. The following langauges were used: CSS, Html, JavaScript, JQuery and Three.js.

## Bugs to fix
This project is not finished yet. To create a smoother experience I would like to implement the following fixes in the future: 
1. Use bootstrap to simplfy and decrease the size of the extensive css file and to have a nicer and better responsiveness of the grid.
2. Implement soundtrack to contribute to the overall experience.
