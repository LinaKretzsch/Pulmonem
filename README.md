# Pulmonem

This project Pulmonem is a speculative web project created for the class Porject Studio CART 411 at Concordia University. The project is composed of a 3D rendered video, a 3D generated Model, a snapchat filter and a final Website presenting all those works. The project is based on a dystopian future where human are unable to breath earth's air and have to inject themselves with DNA altering substances to create additional, pulmonary organs.
